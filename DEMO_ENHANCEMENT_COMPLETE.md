```bash
# Execute rollback script
wrangler d1 execute music_releases_db --command "
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Delete new content items
DELETE FROM content_items WHERE id LIKE 'demo-%';

-- Reset milestone_id on original content
UPDATE content_items SET milestone_id = NULL
WHERE project_id = 'b434c7af-5501-4ef7-a640-9cb19b2fe28d';

-- Delete files and notes
DELETE FROM file_notes WHERE file_id LIKE 'demo-%';
DELETE FROM files WHERE id LIKE 'demo-%';
